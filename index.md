Menghan is working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Climate Econometrics research group at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.

Her research focuses on climate process modeling using econometric tools and inferences on economic consequences of climate change. Speciaifcally, she works on impacts of climate change on aggregate economy, crop yields, human health, and financial asset pricing.
